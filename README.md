- Modular multiplicative inverse is an important part of any cryptographic implementation. Write a code that calculates the Modular multiplicative inverse of a number using the Euclidean Algorithm? Please write this in Rust. Please heavily comment your code so it provides a lot of explainer to someone who has experience programming but is new to Rust and the Euclidean Algorithm. 


### Here is the finished solution to the research [Modular Multiplicative Inverse Implemented in Rust](src/main.rs)
